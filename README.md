## To get started with this assessment: 

1. Fork this repository and then clone it to your local macchine. help -- https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/
2. Run "npm install" to install all dependecies
3. Run "npm start" to view application on localhost:3000
4. Complete the 4 specs listed below
5. Commit your changes and push your work back up to your forked branch - NO LATER THAN 75 MINUTES AFTER STARTING ASSESSMENT

-----------

Scope out the codebase and check out the application running on port 3000, to get an idea of what you are starting with. 

This repository contains a skeleton react application to add, fetch and display a list of books. 

You have 75 minutes to complete this challenge, so even if you have not yet finish all of the specs below, you still MUST push all of your work back up to your branch to be reviewed.

##### DO NOT FORGET TO COMMIT AND PUSH YOUR WORK NO LATER THAN 75 MINUTES AFTER STARTING ASSESSMENT

-----------

## Please complete following *specs* to provide user functionality: 

**1.** When a user clicks the "Get Top 10 Books by Ken Follet" button, a list of novels by author Ken Follett are fetched and displayed in an ordered list below. The JSON containing the data can be found in the repo's public folder, fetch all the data and diplay the book's titles. [x]

**3.** If a user has already added books to the list, then when they add a new custom book or fetch Ken Follet's bestsellers - the books should always append to the end/bottom of the preexisting list. [x] 

**4.** Each item in the list should have the ability to be deleted. BE AWARE that there may be duplicate books, i.e. the same book may be added twice or more to list - if you delete one, the others should remain on the list. [x]

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
